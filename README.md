## Link to my live site

## Usage instructions
- Type anything in the search area and 10 pictures will be generated
- There is a maximum of 10 pictures and there is two ways to display them on the carousel by clicking on them or by clicking on the dots in the dark line.

## Unsolved problems
- The pictures size is not the same
- The pictures should be all above the dark line
- The app can be further enhanced with additional features such as filters for GIF categories, favorites management, or more advanced UI elements.

## Bonus
- The Giphy Search App successfully demonstrates how to build a React app that integrates with an external API (Giphy) and implements a smooth user interface using features like a carousel.
